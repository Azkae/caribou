# Caribou

Create your own REST client GUI with a few line of code: 
see `ex.py` for a configuration example.

```
pip3 install -e .
caribou ex.py
```

Inspired by `click` and `requests`.

Todos:

- auto reload config file
- check for route / group duplicates
- fix request preview for Content-Type other than json
- add open in editor button
- add the ability to edit the raw preview
- search backward
- add color for get & post in readme
- add a list type? (which widget?)
- package in a .app
