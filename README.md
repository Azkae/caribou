# Caribou

Under progress.

Inspired by `click` and `requests`.

Create your own REST client GUI with a few line of code: 
see `ex.py` for a configuration example.

```
pip install -e .
caribou ex.py
```

Todos:

- search in routes
- auto reload config file
- check for route / group duplicates
- persist parameter values
- fix request preview for Content-Type other than json
- add open in editor button
